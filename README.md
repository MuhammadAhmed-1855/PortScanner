**Introduction:**

The Port Discovery Tool is a Python program designed to facilitate the identification of open ports on target systems using various port scanning techniques. This README provides an overview of the tool, its usage, and implementation details.

**Features:**

- Supports multiple port scanning techniques, including SYN Scan, Stealth Scan, FIN Scan, NULL Scan, XMAS Scan, Maimon Scan, ACK Flag Scan, TTL Based Scan, Window Scan, ICMP Ping Scan, and UDP Ping Scan.
- User-friendly interface with prompts for target IP address, port range selection, and scan technique.
- Detailed scan results highlighting open and closed ports, along with additional information where applicable (e.g., window size for Window Scan).
- Option to exit the tool gracefully.

**Usage:**

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the Port Discovery Tool repository.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the tool's Python script.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python PortDiscover.py
   ```
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the target IP address and select the desired port scanning technique.
7. If required, input the port range for specific scans (e.g., SYN Scan, Stealth Scan).
8. Review the scan results displayed in the terminal.

**Implementation Details:**

- The Port Discovery Tool is implemented in Python 3.
- It utilizes the Scapy library for crafting and sending packets, allowing for flexible and efficient network communication.
- Each port scanning technique is implemented as a separate function within the Python script, enabling modularity and ease of maintenance.
- Error handling mechanisms are incorporated to gracefully handle user input errors and unexpected network conditions.
- The tool leverages Python's standard input/output functionalities for interaction with the user and displaying scan results.
